# Riemann Sum Visualizer

## https://jonahb55.github.io/RiemannSumVisualizer/

This tool allows you to visualize the process of calculating a Riemann sum for any provided function. The following rules are supported:

- Left Hand Rule
- Right Hand Rule
- Midpoint Rule
- Trapezoidal Rule

After entering a function, rule, and x range (interval), try increasing the n value to provide more accurate estimates of the integral. The graph of the integral is displayed on the lower half of the page along with the numerical result to the right.

## Function Dictionary

The function field and ranges are evaluated as standard JavaScript. Below are a few example functions/constants that are available:

- `x ** 2`
- `Math.sin(x)`
- `Math.cos(x)`
- `Math.tan(x)`
- `Math.PI`
- `Math.E`
- `Math.log(x)` (natural log)
- `Math.log10(x)`
